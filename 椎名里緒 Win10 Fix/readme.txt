------ What is it?  ------

This is an experimental workaround for older RioShiina engine games
that do not start correctly on Windows 8 and 10.

There is no guarantee that it will work on every affected game since
only a few titles have been tested.


------- How to use -------

1. Copy the .dll file into the game folder
2. Play the game
